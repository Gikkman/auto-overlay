# auto-overlay

A small program for automatically adding a overlay image on top of a all images in a folder (and subfolders). The program will automatically scale the overlay to fit the image we're trying to apply it to. Scaled overlays retain their dimensions, so some cropping may occur if overlay and image don't have matching proportions.
